“I have done this assignment completely on our own. I have not copied it, nor have I
given my solution to anyone else. I understand that if we are involved in plagiarism or
cheating I will have to sign an official form that we have cheated and that this form will
be stored in my official university record. I also understand that I will receive a grade of 0
for the involved assignment and my grade will be reduced by one level (e.g., from A to
B) for my offense, and that I will receive a grade of “F” for the course in the case of
egregious examples or any additional offense of any kind.”
